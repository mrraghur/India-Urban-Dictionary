Why do we need this?
Because There are many things not covered by UrbanDictionary.com. I wish I had known these things when I was young and idealistic. It took me 15 yrs to understand the nonsense that is Indian news media.

# Political Euphemisms.

* **We will not be responsible for consequences**
  * It is usually used when a party/person who wants to threaten the government indirectly. Eg: Lets say Party or Person 'A' saus `If you arrest Swami Rajneeshananda, then devotees will revolt and Govt will be responsible for ensuing violence.` It basically means, 'A' will instigate his supporters/minions to incite violence if Govt still arrests Swami Rajneeshananda. In India, most people think consider violence ok when their leader is attacked. Hence, people like 'A' can get away by making statements like these.
   * TODO: Add an example from internet/news sites

* **We will give evidence at appropriate time**
  * This statement is usually made in the midst of a controversy between two or more parties (say A & B). In order to bluff (especially when they are loosing), one of the parties makes this statement. Since everything is mud slinging based, you can be sure that both parties would reveal any evidence as soon as they have. You can safely ignore such statements and concentrate on remaining news coming out.
  
* **Officer on special duty**
  * I have noted this in Andhra Pradesh. Its a fig leaf post given to a ruling party's minion/chamcha. His only qualification would be that he is close friend of someone in power. Often, these people are lobbyists in the government and can control who sees or does not see in the Chief minister, special secretary etc. Sample case

* **India is the only place where women are worshipped**
  * Whenever an issue of women's empowerment comes up, this is a statement typically made to distract from the discussion at hand. In Hinduism, which is big in India, there are many goddesses/female deities. Example Lakshmi is goddess of wealth. This worship of a few women is shown as saying life of most Indian woman is good and that most Indian men are not lecherers, rapists, misogynists, etc. Unfortunately, truth is opposite.
  
* **Case booked for hurting our religious feelings and disturbing public order**
  * In India, most people think one's religious beliefs should not be hurt, lest they react violently. Freedom of speech is not well protected. So, when government wants to punish an individual or assuage feelings of a particular group, it uses its wide latitude in enforcing rules and arrests individuals under abobve clause. This is why unless you are a goonda like Bal Thackeray, you cannot make too many statements against other religions.
  
* **Law will takes its own course and do its work**
  * Typically this statement is made when a huge scam/corruption is discovered and members of ruling party are the culprits. Since they are members of ruling party and hence friends, government officals/ministers do not want to arrest the culprits and bring to book. So, they act like they will allow police and courts to function without any interference from vested interests.  They want to give an impression of free and fair administration. Hence, some responsible minister/chief minister etc will make this statement. Although, in the background, you can be sure that there is some political pressure on law enforcement officials.
  
  
#Cultural Issues  
  
* **A woman should dress modestly. Otherwise, men can do anything they want**
  * In India, most people do not believe in taking responsibility for their actions. They think some reactions are natural, given the circumstances. For example, these people do not believe that its natural that men get excited and loose control when a woman shows more that usual amount of skin. Unfortunately, they do not believe that these men should control feelins irrespective of how the woman acts. Its her body and her wish. The man needs to learn to control his urges. This is part of a larger problem where many Indians (men and women) believe there is something called social norms and if we step out of it, then bad, violent consequences are natural. Most Indians believe that in such cases, rule of law cannot help. Hence they don't think police can help in these cases.
  
* **How can a chief minister prevent an how a restaurant treats you (TODO: Expand later)


* **Crores of people are living happily in India, why can't you**
  * This statement is usually made by friends and family when one says life in India is painful, tough etc. They take current standard of lifestyle as good and not something that can be improved upon. They instinctively kill your dreams when you aspire for a better standard of living.
