# Political

* **We will not be responsible for consequences**
  * It is usually used when a party/person who wants to threaten the government indirectly. Eg: Lets say Party or Person 'A' saus `If you arrest Swami Rajneeshananda, then devotees will revolt and Govt will be responsible for ensuing violence.` It basically means, 'A' will instigate his supporters/minions to incite violence if Govt still arrests Swami Rajneeshananda. In India, most people think consider violence ok when their leader is attacked. Hence, people like 'A' can get away by making statements like these.
