# Political Euphemisms.

* **We will not be responsible for consequences**
  * It is usually used when a party/person who wants to threaten the government indirectly. Eg: Lets say Party or Person 'A' saus `If you arrest Swami Rajneeshananda, then devotees will revolt and Govt will be responsible for ensuing violence.` It basically means, 'A' will instigate his supporters/minions to incite violence if Govt still arrests Swami Rajneeshananda. In India, most people think consider violence ok when their leader is attacked. Hence, people like 'A' can get away by making statements like these.
   * TODO: Add an example from internet/news sites

* **We will give evidence at appropriate time**
  * This statement is usually made in the midst of a controversy between two or more parties (say A & B). In order to bluff (especially when they are loosing), one of the parties makes this statement. Since everything is mud slinging based, you can be sure that both parties would reveal any evidence as soon as they have. You can safely ignore such statements and concentrate on remaining news coming out.
  
* **Officer on special duty**
  * I have noted this in Andhra Pradesh. Its a fig leaf post given to a ruling party's minion/chamcha. His only qualification would be that he is close friend of someone in power. Often, these people are lobbyists in the government and can control who sees or does not see in the Chief minister, special secretary etc. Sample case

* **India is the only place where women are worshipped**
  * Whenever an issue of women's empowerment comes up, this is a statement typically made to distract from the discussion at hand. In Hinduism, which is big in India, there are many goddesses/female deities. Example Lakshmi is goddess of wealth. This worship of a few women is shown as saying life of most Indian woman is good and that most Indian men are not lecherers, rapists, misogynists, etc. Unfortunately, truth is opposite.
